KITE

Kite is a prototype web-based operating system.
Files and web media (e.g., Tweets, Spotify playlists) live on an infinite canvas with an optional hierarchy.
Actions are single-purpose programs that act on items on the canvas (e.g., summarize a group of files/tweets, remove b/g noise from audio).
Built with collaboration as a first-class citizen.
