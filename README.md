# welcome to groupthink!
This is the private repo for the groupthink information management tool.  
### Quick Start
*Parcel* scripts are already set up in `package.json`. 
To set up the environment, run `yarn install`. To start the local development server (with hot module replacement), run `yarn start`. To create a production build (without any source maps), run `yarn build`. This will clear the existing contents of `/dist` and output minified production code to it.
